Applying a standard Matlab function or operation to one or more quib arguments, or to a combination of quib arguments and standard Matlab arrays, produces a new functional quib whose function is to perform the indicated operation. Quibs can work with most standard Matlab functions, as well as with array referencing, concatenation and graphics. We can therefore very easily define functional quibs using standard Matlab syntax.\n",

    "Quibs are defined declaratively (lazy evaluation). In general, quib operations are declarative; they define quibs with assigned functions, but do not execute these functions. Quib's function are only calculated upon requested. For example, the statement above, 'sumXsqr = sum(Xsqr);' creates a new quib whose function is to perform sum(Xsqr), but because of the semicolon at the end, Matlab does not display the result and therefore the output of the summation is not yet needed and the summation itself is not performed. The summation is only performed in the second line 'sumXsqr', where the quib is displayed and its output is thereby requested.\n",

For example, suppose we change one of the elements of our input quib X:\n",
