    "### Quibbler easily creates live interactive graphics\n",
    "\n",
    "Quibs can be used as arguments in most *Matplotlib* graphics functions, creating *graphics quibs* - quibs that represents \"live\", reactive-interactive, graphics. Indeed, such graphics quibs are bi-directionally linked to their source data. Any changes to upstream quibs are propagated downstream to immediately affect the graphics; and, conversely, user interactions with the graphics (dragging, clicking) propagates backwards to affect the values of upstream quibs. Combining quibs with widgets and graphics, we can thereby readily create a highly interactive app-like analysis of our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, such interactive pipelines are naturally created in *Quibbler* without us needing to worry about the traditional, and often tedious, programming of specific callback functions for each interactive behavior. Unlike in \"regular\" programming, where in order to create interactive analysis we need to specifically program callback functions for each graphics object or widget, in *Quibbler*, we inherently get interactive functionality without requiring us to deal with such what-to-do-if behaviors. Instead, we can set our mind on the analysis from a data-oriented forward-looking standpoint, and let *Quibbler* deal with any asynchronous graphics or widget events, deciding what needs to change, what needs to re-run, and what to re-plot in order to make things interactive and fun.
