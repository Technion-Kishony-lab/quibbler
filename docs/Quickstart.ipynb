Indeed, running this code plots the marker and the text as classically expected. Yet, unlike in classical programming, in *Quibbler* the data items and graphics are all bi-directionally linked. First, assigning new values to an upstream variable, say assigning `xy[0] = 300` immediately refreshes all downstream graphics. Second, the plotted marker is in fact draggable and, as we drag it, we see that it leads to changes in the upstream variable `xy` and in any dependent graphics."

    "### How does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we briefly explain the above example, while providing a more general view of *Quibbler* functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The quib object\n",
    "*Quibbler* functionality is based on the *quib* object. The quib is an object that represents an output *value* as well as the *function* and *arguments* used to calculate this value. There are two major types of quibs: input-quibs (i-quibs) which take a regular *Python* object as their argument and present it as their value, and function-quibs (f-quibs) that calculate their output value by applying a given function to a given list of arguments, which could include other quibs and any other *Python* objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input-quibs\n",
    "Input-quibs are created using the function `iquib`, which transforms any regular *Python* object into a quib. In our case `xy = iquib(np.array([50, 50]))` creates an i-quib `xy` whose value is the *NumPy* array `[50, 50]`. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Function-quibs\n",
    "Function-quibs are created naturally whenever we use quibs as part of standard expressions or functions. Indeed, *Quibbler* modifies standard functions and operators such that they can work directly with quibs. Such Quibbler-supported functions, also called _quiby functions_, include not only many standard *Python*, *NumPy* and *Matplotlib* functions (see [[Quiby functions]]), but also operators (such as `+`, `-`, `<`, `>`, `**`, `@`), and any array indexing syntax. We can therefore easily define a chained network of function quibs using standard programming syntax. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, the commands `x = xy[0]` and `y = xy[1]` create the f-quibs `x` and `y` whose function is to reference `xy` at positions 0 and 1, respectively. Next, the command `plt.plot(x, y, ...)` defines an f-quib whose function is to perform `plt.plot` on the values of `x` and `y`. Similarly, `y + 4` is a function quib that adds 4 to the value of `y`, `np.array2string(xy)` is a function-quib that performs the `array2string` on the value of `xy` and, finally, `plt.text(...)` is a function quib that calls `plt.text` with the values of its quib arguments. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Upstream changes automatically propagate to affect the value of downstream quibs\n",
    "All of these quibs are created *declaratively*: they are functional objects whose value changes upon upstream changes. We can probe the value of any quib using the `get_value` method. When we assign `xy[1] = 70`, we change the value of `xy` which in turn changes the value of `y`, which in turn changes the plot and the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interaction with the graphics is inverse-propagated to a change upstream quib values\n",
    "The relation above can also go backwards. When we indicate `picker=True` in a plot command, *Quibbler* allows draggin the plotted graphics and translates such user interactions with the graphics into assignments to the corresponding quib arguments of the plt.plot function and from there further upstream to input quibs. In our case dragging the marker is translated into assignments to the `x` and `y` quibs. Since `x` and `y` are function quibs, the assignment is further inverse-propagated upstream to the i-quib `xy` where it is actualized (see [[Inverse assignments]]). The change in `xy` then percolates downstream to affect the text position its string label."
