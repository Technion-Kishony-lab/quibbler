Following import, we need to execute `qb.override_all()` which configures *NumPy* and *Matplotlib* functions to work with *Quibbler*. A typical import therefore looks as follows:"

Indeed, running this code plots the marker and the text as classically expected. Yet, unlike this standard behavior, here the data items and graphics are all bi-directionally linked. First, assigning new values to the upstream variable `xy` immediately moves the marker and refreshes the text to reflect the change. Second, the plotted marker can be dragged and as we drag it, the position and label of the text automatically change."

    "### How does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we briefly explain the above example, while providing a more general view of *Quibbler* functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The quib object\n",
    "*Quibbler* functionality is based on the *quib* object. The quib is an object that represents an output *value* as well as the *function* and *arguments* used to calculate this value. There are two major types of quibs: input-quibs (i-quibs) which take a regular *Python* object as their argument and present it as their value, and function-quibs (f-quibs) that calculate their output value by applying a given function to a given list of arguments, which could include other quibs and any other *Python* objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input-quibs\n",
    "Input-quibs are created using the function `iquib`, which transforms any regular *Python* object into an i-quib. In our case `xy = iquib(np.array([1., 1.]))` creates an i-quib `xy` whose value is *NumPy* array `[1., 1.]`. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Function-quibs\n",
    "Function-quibs are then created naturally whenever we use quibs as part of standard expressions or functions. Indeed, *Quibbler* modifies standard functions and operators such that they can work directly with quibs. Such Quibbler-supported functions, also called _quiby functions_, include not only many standard *Python*, *NumPy* and *Matplotlib* functions (see [full list[Quiby functions]]), but also operators (such as `+`, `-`, `<`, `>`, `**`, `@`), and array indexing. We can therefore easily define a chained network of function quibs using standard *Python* syntax. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, when our code executes `x = xy[0]` and `y = xy[1]` it creates the f-quibs `x` and `y` whose function is to reference the quib `xy` at positions 0 and 1, respectively. Next, the command `plt.plot(x, y, ...)` defines an f-quib whose function is to perform `plt.plot` on the values of `x` and `y`. Similarly, `y + 0.05` is a function quib that adds 0.05 to the value of `y`, `np.array2string(xy, ...)` is a function-quib that performs the `array2string` on the value of `xy` and, finally, `plt.text(...)` is a function quib that calls `plt.text` with the values of its quib arguments. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Upstream changes automatically propagate to affect downstream results\n",
    "All of these quibs are created *declaratively*: they are functional objects whose value changes upon upstream changes. Thereby, when we assign `xy[1] = 0.5`, this changes `y`, which in turn changes the plot and the text. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interaction with the graphics is inverse-propagated to a change upstream quib values\n",
    "The relation above can also go backwards. Changing the graphics by dragging the marker is translated into an assignment to the corresponding arguments of the plt.plot function, the `x` and `y` quibs. Since `x` and `y` are functional quibs, the assignment is further inverse-propagated upstream to the i-quib `xy` where it is actualized. The change in `xy` then percolates downstream to affect the text position and text label."
