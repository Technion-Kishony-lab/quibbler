This functionality is enabled by checking the \"Show Quibs under Notebook cells\" option in the *Quibbler* menu. Then, when we execute a given notebook cell, any newly created overriding-accepting quibs will automatically appear as push buttons below the notebook cell (overriding-accepting quibs include input quibs, or function quibs whose [[Quib.allow_overriding]] is set to `True`; see [[Overriding-default-functionality]]). \n",

    "Overriding assignments to quibs can be saved as part of the notebook, allowing restoring prior values both within the session and when restarting the notebook as a new session. In chapter [[Project-save-load]], we reviewed how quib assignments can be saved into external files. The *Jupyter lab* extension allows us instead to save quib assignments into the notebook, which is typically much simpler and convenient. To enable saving quib assignments into the notebook check the \"Save/Load inside Notebook\" option in the Jupyter lab *Quibbler* menu. \n",
