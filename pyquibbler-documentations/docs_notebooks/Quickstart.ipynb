First, assigning new values to an upstream variable, say assigning `xy[0] = 100`, immediately refreshes all downstream graphics.

    "### How does it work?\n",
    "Below, we briefly explain the above example, while providing a more general view of *Quibbler* functionality. You can also skip this section and continue with building our image-cutting example app below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The quib object\n",
    "*Quibbler* functionality is based on the [[Quib]] object. The quib is an object that represents an output *value* as well as the *function* and *arguments* used to calculate this value. There are two major types of quibs: input-quibs (i-quibs) which take a regular *Python* object as their argument and present it as their value, and function-quibs (f-quibs) that calculate their output value by applying a given function to a given list of arguments, which could include other quibs and any other *Python* objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input-quibs\n",
    "Input-quibs are created using the function [[qb.iquib]], which transforms any regular *Python* object into a quib. In our case `xy = iquib([250, 250])` creates an i-quib `xy` whose value is the list `[250, 250]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Function-quibs\n",
    "Function-quibs are created naturally whenever we use quibs as part of standard expressions or functions. Indeed, *Quibbler* modifies standard functions and operators such that they can work directly with quibs. Such *Quibbler*-supported functions, also called _quiby_ functions, include not only many standard *Python*, *NumPy* and *Matplotlib* functions (see [[List-of-quiby-functions]]), but also operators (such as `+`, `-`, `<`, `>`, `**`, `@`, etc.), and any indexing syntax (e.g., if `xy` is a quib, `x = xy[0]` is a function quib). We can therefore easily define a chained network of function quibs using standard programming syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, `x, y = xy` creates the f-quibs `x = xy[0]` and `y = xy[1]` whose function is to reference `xy` at positions 0 and 1, respectively. Next, the command `plt.plot(x, y, ...)` defines an f-quib whose function is to perform `plt.plot` on the *values* of `x` and `y`. Similarly, `y + 30` is a function quib that adds 30 to the value of `y`, and then `plt.text(...)` is a function quib that calls the *Matplotlib* function `plt.text` with the values of its quib arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Upstream changes automatically propagate to affect the value of downstream quibs\n",
    "All of these quibs are created *declaratively*: they are functional objects whose value changes upon upstream changes. As seen in the video above, we can probe the value of any quib using the `get_value` method. When we make an assignment to the upstream i-quib `xy`, say assigning `xy[0] = 100`, we change the value of `xy`, which in turn changes the value of `x`, which in turn changes the plot and the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interaction with the graphics is inverse-propagated, leading to changes in upstream quibs\n",
    "The relation above can also go backward. *Quibbler* allows dragging the plotted graphics while translating such user interactions with the graphics into assignments to the corresponding quib arguments of the plt.plot function. Such assignments into the arguments of the plot function are then *inverse-propagated* further upstream, ultimately actualized as changes to upstream quibs (typically reaching upstream i-quibs; see [[Inverse-assignments]]). In our case dragging the marker is initially translated into assignments to the `x` and `y` quibs. Since `x` and `y` are function quibs, these assignments are further inverse-propagated upstream to the i-quib `xy` where they are actualized. The resulting change in `xy` then percolates downstream to affect the plotted marker as well as text position and the text label."

    "### Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have seen, *Quibbler* provides a fast, easy and intuitive way to analyze data in an inherently interactive way. Notably, such interactive analysis appears naturally in *Quibbler* without us needing to worry about the traditional, and often tedious, programming of specific callback functions for each interactive behavior. Instead, we can set our mind on the analysis from a data-oriented forward-looking standpoint, and let *Quibbler* deal with any asynchronous graphics or widget events.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other major features of *Quibbler*\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond **Interactivity**, other important capabilities of *Quibbler*, not demonstrated above, include:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Efficiency.** Upon changes to parameters, *Quibbler* tracks and identifies which specific downstream data items, or even specific elements thereof, are affected and only recalculates these affected items. See [[Diverged-evaluation]].\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Traceability** *Quibbler* allows us to easily probe which specific inputs affect a downstream result, and vise versa, which downstream results are affected by a given focal parameter. See [[Quib.ancestors]], [[Quib.descendants]].\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Overriding**. Function quibs can be overridden, streamlining exception specifications to default behaviors. See [[Overriding-default-functionality]].\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Transparency.** Inputs, as well as exceptions and overrides, are saved in simple human-readable files. See [[Project-save-load]] and the *Quibbler* Jupyer lab extension (no docs yet)."
